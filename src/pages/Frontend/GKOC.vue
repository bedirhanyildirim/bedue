            KRİL YAĞININ ÖNEMİ NEDİR?
          </h2>
          <span class="text-black block my-4 text-lg text-justify">
            Kril yağı, okyanuslarda yaşayan ‘’Euphausia superba’’ adlı bir deniz canlısından elde edilen bir maddedir. Kril yağı yüksek oranda omega-3 yağ asitleri içerir ve bu yağ asitleri fosfolipit yapısındadır. Aynı zamanda astaksantin, Vitamin A ve Vitamin E yönünden de zengin olan krill yağı gerek bileşiminin zenginliği gerekse de sağlık faydaları açısından önemli bir besin takviyesidir.
          </span>
          <span class="text-black block my-4 text-lg text-justify">
            Kril yağı son yıllarda balık yağından daha fazla önem kazanmıştır. Krillerin açık ve temiz denizlerde yaşam sürmesi, toksin ve ağır metal içermemeleri adına da avantaj sağlamaktadır. Ayrıca okyanus ekosisteminde kril biyokütlesi önemli yer oluşturmaktadır ve dünyadaki en yaygın kabuklulardır. Dünyadaki en büyük biyokütle olmaları nedeniyle de soy tükenme tehdidi olmadan omega-3 takviyelerine ham madde kaynağı oluşturmaktadır.
          </span>
          <span class="text-black block my-4 text-lg text-justify">
            Kril yağı, balık yağına benzer yağ asitleri kompozisyonuna sahiptir. EPA ve DHA bunlardan en önemlileridir. Bu yağların; inflamasyonu düşüren, hücre membran geçişini güçlendiren, kolesterol değerlerini dengeleyen ve kan trombositlerini daha az yapışkan hale getiren özellikleri olduğu yapılan araştırmalarca gösterilmiştir.

            Kril yağı ile yapılan araştırmalar balık yağlarında olduğu gibi EPA ve DHA’nın önemine dikkat çekmekle birlikte, içerisinde yer alan fosfolipitler de bu araştırmalara konu olmuştur. Çalışmalarda genellikle terapötik etki için günde 500-1000 mg alınması önerilmektedir.
